A main scene with 2 Different Sprites, one being the background and the other being two different godot robots.
Another instance of a different scene with different colored godot robots.


My question is, whenever I run the project, and try to scale the screen, it wouldn't scale with the background image. How would I go about resizing the window changing the background size.
